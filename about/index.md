## Welcome to Jekyll Golden
Jekyll Golden is a Jekyll theme in which the layout and typography are based on the Golden Ratio, 1:1.618.

### Jekyll
You'll find this page in your `about` directory - edit this page and
re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!

### Posts
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

### Archives
Check out the [Archives] page to view all the posts.

#### Code
Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
