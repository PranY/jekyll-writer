## Welcome to Jekyll Writer
Jekyll Writer is a simple Jekyll blogging theme with a responsive, mobile-first
layout and stylish, easy to read typography.

### Jekyll
Jekyll is a powerful static website generator. It takes raw markup files and templates
and compiles them into a complete, static HTML website.

Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind [GitHub Pages] which is easily Jekyllâ€™s
most attractive hosting solution. With it you can simply upload your Jekyll blog
to a free GitHub repository and have it automatically compiled and deployed each
time you commit.

### Posts
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

### Archives
Check out the [Archives] page to view all the posts.

#### Code
Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

##### Info
